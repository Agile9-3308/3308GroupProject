## Overview
This document captures the **weekly status** of the Agile Flow project for the specified reporting period. It is intended to provide a **concise snapshot** of progress, plans, and risks, and will be updated weekly throughout the project.

This weekly status format is designed to:
- Monitor progress over time
- Surface risks and bottlenecks early
- Provide accountability for individual contributions
- Supplement the project management tool used by the team

---

## Project Management Snapshot
The team is using a shared **Jira board** to manage tasks and sprint progress. At the time of this report:
- Columns include: 
- Tasks are assigned to individual team members
- Due dates and priorities are tracked per task

(A visual snapshot of the board may be included in the repository alongside this file.)

## Progress Since Last Week

This week, the team focused on **initial project setup and scope definition**. Major infrastructure and planning milestones were completed to prepare for active development.

Key accomplishments include:
- Creation of a shared GitHub repository with all members added
- Establishment of a basic frontend and backend project structure
- Agreement on the minimum viable product (MVP) feature set
- Initial wireframe sketches for core pages (scheduling and tasks)

---

## Completed Tasks
- Created GitHub repository and added all team members  
- Established baseline frontend and backend directory structure  
- Set up Trello project board with initial task breakdown  
- Defined MVP feature scope  
- Drafted initial user stories for availability scheduling and task management  

---

## Planned Tasks for Next Week
- Design and implement the initial database schema  
- Create basic backend routes for users and groups  
- Begin frontend page layout for scheduling and task views  
- Refine wireframes based on team feedback and milestone requirements  

---

## Blockers and Issues
No major technical blockers were encountered this week.

One discussion point involved balancing MVP scope versus optional enhancements. The team agreed to:
- Focus on a **simple availability overlap view**
- Defer advanced calendar interactions until later milestones (if time allows)

---

## Risks and Mitigation
**Identified Risk:** Feature creep  
- *Mitigation:* Strict adherence to MVP scope and milestone requirements

**Identified Risk:** Frontend/backend integration complexity  
- *Mitigation:* Develop and test API endpoints incrementally, starting early

---

## Team Reflection
The team reported:
- Strong communication and consistent participation
- Clear alignment on goals and responsibilities
- Confidence in the project direction entering the development phase

The weekly status format was found to be useful for maintaining accountability and focus.
