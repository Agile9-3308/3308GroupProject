## Vision Statement

AgileBoard is a productivity visualization application that allows end users to plan, track,
and monitor project milestones through use of Agile Methodologies. This app allows end users to
create task cards, burndown/burnup charts, timelines and other data visulization elements on
a universally accessible web browser interface, with a focus on mobile-responsive design for
expanded device access.

---
## Motivation

In a landscape of Agile productivity apps that are limited by pay-walling, it would be
ideal to have a free option that gets the job done. This would broaden access to implementation
of Agile for users of many different backgrounds, including students and early-career
professionals with potentially limited financial resources. An additional inspiration is
to align with the long-held standard of open source tools in software development, and
the broader technology industry as a whole.



* Inspired by pay walls (open source kinda)
* most agile software is not free for students - payment walls hinder project management
* Learn the agile method by making a tool for it
* Make it easy to plan and visualize
* Promote the Agile methods

## Risks to Project Completion

**Scheduling and Coordination:**
- Team members exist across multiple time zones, creating dificulties in scheduling

**Time Management:**
- All team members are enrolled in multiple classes, meaning that workloads from other
classes may interfere with this project, at times
- All team members have jobs that will pull focus from this project at times

**Project Scope and Prior Expertise:**
- Scope creep is possible with projects that are expandable like this
- Possible limited experience with the chosen stack

---
## Mitigation Strategy

**Scheduling and Coordination:**
- Team will make a point to stay in touch via a Discord server that is well-organized
- Weekly, and sometimes more frequent, team meetings to check in and accomplish tasks
as a group
- When scheduling meetings, team members will ensure that time zones are included

**Time Management:**
- Time management is largely an individual responsbility, but team members will openly
communicate when there are significant difficulties on this topic
- Making it a priority to discuss expectations around time management, during each
Scrum meeting

**Project Scope:**
- Prioritizing collective code ownership, utilizing strategies such as code reviews
and pair programming, so that team members remain on the same page in terms of
familiarity with project architecture and development environment conventions
- Staying focused on MVP (not running away with too many features/embellishments)
- Team members will do the groundwork of familiarizing themselves with technologies
with which they have limited to no experience

## Development Method

*Track work using a simple board
*Use the board to limit work in progress
*Continuously improve with agile reports

Our team will follow an Agile development method with sprint-based approach with
scheduled weekly meetings on Sundays at 12pm MT where we will cover things like short
development iterations and continuous integration. We will break tasks into small,
testable components to allow the project to adapt based on progress and challenges.

---
## Development Steps
1. Define core user stories and functional requirements.
2. Design database schema for users, groups, tasks, and availability.
3. Implement backend API endpoints for scheduling and task management.
4. Build frontend views for calendars, task lists, and progress summaries.
5. Integrate frontend and backend components.
6. Conduct testing and prepare final presentation and documentation.
---
## Project Tracking
The team will use Jira to track tasks, sprint progress, and blockers. Tasks will
be labeled by priority and assigned to individual team members to maintain
accountability.
---
## Technology Stack
### Frontend
- HTML/CSS for layout and styling
- JavaScript with React for interactive UI components
### Backend
- Python with Flask for RESTful API development
### Database
- SQLite for development, with the option to migrate to PostgreSQL
