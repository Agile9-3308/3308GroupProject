## Vision Statement

AgileBoard is a productivity visualization application that allows end users to plan, track, and monitor project milestones through use of Agile Methodologies. This app allows end users to create task cards, burndown/burnup charts, timelines and other data visulization elements on a universally accessible web browser interface, with a focus on mobile-responsive design for expanded device access.

## Motivation

In a landscape of Agile productivity apps that are limited by pay-walling, it would be ideal to have a free option that gets the job done. This would broaden access to implementation of Agile for users of many different backgrounds, including students and early-career professionals with potentially  limited financial resources. An additional inspiration is to align with the long-held standard of open source tools in software development, and the broader technology industry as a whole.

## Risks to Project Completion

**Scheduling and Coordination:**
- Team members exist across multiple time zones, creating difficulties in scheduling

**Time Management:**
- All team members are enrolled in multiple classes, meaning that workloads from other classes may interfere with this project, at times
- All team members have jobs that will pull focus from this project at times

**Project Scope:**
- Scope creep is possible with projects that are expandable like this
- Possible limited experience with the chosen tech stack

---
---

## Mitigation Strategy

**Scheduling and Coordination:**
- Team will make a point to stay in touch via a Discord server that is well-organized
- Weekly, and sometimes more frequent, team meetings to check in and accomplish tasks as a group
- When scheduling meetings, team members will ensure that time zones are included

**Time Management:**
- Time management is largely an individual responsbility, but team members will openly communicate when there are significant difficulties on this topic
- Making it a priority to discuss expectations around time management, during each Scrum meeting

**Project Scope:**
- Prioritizing collective code ownership, utilizing strategies such as code reviews and pair programming, so that team members remain on the same page in terms of familiarity with project architecture and development environment conventions
- Staying focused on MVP (not running away with too many features/embellishments)
- Team members will do the groundwork of familiarizing themselves with technologies with which they have limited to no experience

## Development Method

The team will follow an Agile development method, utilizing the sprint-based approach. These sprints will be punctuated by scheduled weekly meetings on Sundays at 12pm MT,during which the team will review things like short development iterations and continuous integration. This will allow the team to break tasks into small, testable components, allowing the project to maintain healthy progression while adapting to new challenges.

---
---

## Development Steps
1. Define core **user stories** and **functional requirements**.
2. Design **database schema** for users, groups, tasks, and availability.
3. Implement back end **API endpoints** for scheduling and task management.
4. **Integrate** front end and back end information flows.
5. Build out and **refine front end views** for calendars, task lists, and progress summaries.
6. **Construct test suites** for robust functionality of front and back ends, accounting for edge cases.
7. Prepare **final presentation** and comprehensive **documentation**.

## Project Tracking

The team will use Jira to track tasks, sprint progress, and blockers. Tasks will be labeled by priority and assigned to individual team members to maintain accountability. The Jira board will serve both as a great tool for maintaining progress, but also as inspiration for features in the project itself.

## Technology Stack

### Front End
- **HTML/CSS** for layout and styling
- **JavaScript with React** for interactive UI components
- Potential use of **styling frameworks/libraries** such as Tailwind, SemanticUI, Styled Components, or MaterialUI

### Back End
- **Python with Flask** for RESTful API development

### Database
- **SQLite for development**, with the option to migrate to **PostgreSQL**
